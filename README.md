## Features

- Word parser: One of the challenges of understanding Mandarin texts is the lack of spaces between words. This app can easily help you in that regard. Once a text is submitted, it is parsed into words with spaces in-between. You can also add color-coding for even better distinction between adjacent words.
- Dictionary: Looking up meanings is also easy with Read-y. You can view a list of dictionary entries for each word upon a single click. Also, each dictionary entry can be inserted in line for quick reference. When you no longer need a translation, simply click on it to remove it.
- PDF download: You are never going to lose your progress! With Read-y, you can download the text along with pinyin and any translations you added. This way, you can review the text in your favourite editor, or event print it out and carry it along with your other notes.
